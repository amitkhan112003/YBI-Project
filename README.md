This project demonstrates a classification model to identify multiple diseases based on symptoms using a Random Forest Classifier. 
The dataset contains 133 features representing various symptoms, and the target variable is the disease prognosis.
The model is trained on a training dataset (70%) and evaluated on a test dataset (30%) with an accuracy of 100%. 
The confusion matrix and classification report are used to assess model performance across multiple diseases. 
This approach can be applied to automate disease prediction based on symptoms.
